# SoodokuS:star:
Full featured Sudoku board game.
## Made By Damiran - 2019

### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SoodokuS(tar) was made as an inspiration to for solving a Sudoku puzzle
    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main idea was to be able to create/implement **_Enchanted Hybrid Recursive-Backtrack_** solving algorithm.
    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It can solve quickly any Sudoku puzzle.
Even the most difficult(solvable) Sudoku puzzle found was solved in around one second on my machine. Those puzzles that has no solutions are solved even quicker.
    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Java JFrame was used, program runs smoothly, has sounds and perfectly is controlled by mouse and wheel, more (details in options section). Can save/load boards, has hint tokens which are made by solving boards.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my first project in Java. It was intended to get used to Java Programming language. As a by product I was forced to learn JFrames also :). Besides back end logic and algorithms, multiple Java features was used(~6k LOC).

# SoodokuS

  Made By Damiran - 2019
  
      SoodokuS(tar) was made as an inspiration to for solving a Sudoku puzzle.
    
    The main idea was to be able to create/implement Enchanted Hybrid Recursive Backtrack solving algorithm.
    
    Which can solve quickly any Sudoku puzzle.
    Even the most difficult(solvable) Sudoku puzzle found was solved in around one second on my machine.    
    Those puzzles that has no solutions are solved even quicker.
    
    Java Swing was used, program runs smoothly, has sounds and perfectly is controlled by mouse and wheel, more (details in options section)
    Can save/load boards, has hint tokens which are made by solving boards
